emoji of a person sitting in a small boat on calm water, propelling it forward with one oar. They are facing directly towards the viewer. The person has light skin tone. Their arm is bent at a right angle and the oar is held firmly but not too tightly, with the blade dipping into the water about halfway between the bow and stern of the boat. The boat itself is small enough for just one or two people and has a smooth wooden surface in a weathered gray color that shows signs of wear from years of use on the water. The oar's handle is also made of wood, with a slight sheen to it as if it's been recently oiled. 3D lighting. no cast shadows.
