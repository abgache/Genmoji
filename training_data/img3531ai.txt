emoji of a flag with a horizontal blue stripe at the top, followed by a white stripe in the middle, and finally a red stripe at the bottom. The Bulgarian coat of arms is placed in the center of the white stripe, which features a golden crown, two crossed sabers, and an archer's quiver above them. The flag has a golden border around the edges, with the blue stripe being slightly thicker than the others. cute.. detailed texture.. 3D lighting. no cast shadows.
