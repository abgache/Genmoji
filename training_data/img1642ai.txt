emoji of a visually impaired woman guiding herself through a crowd with a sturdy white aluminum cane. her long gray hair falls down her back in loose waves. she wears a pair of trendy, black framed glasses with silver accents on the temples and nose bridge. The cane has a bright red rubber tip at the base for traction. Her dark brown coat is draped over her shoulder, partially covering a crisp white blouse with a subtle floral pattern. 3D lighting. no cast shadows.
